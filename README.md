# Nutrition-Values-
This project analyzes nutritional data. The data being used consists of thousands of different types of foods. For each food, there are various measurements stored â€“ such as the total amount of calories, total amount of sugar, total amount of water, etc. There are nearly 70 of these measurements taken for each sample of food. 

In this analysis, we are interested in seeing which measurements are important when trying to predict how many calories a sample of food will have. An important note, however, is that we are purposefully excluding any fat measurements from our analysis. Because fat is a clear and well-known predictor of calories (i.e. foods high in fat will be high in calories), our analysis aims to present which measurements, beyond fat, are just as important.
